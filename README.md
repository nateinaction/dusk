# Dusk ðŸŒ‘

Dusk is a minimal dependency Go library for calculating astronomical twilight, the lunar phase and the rise and set times of the moon and sun.

## Installation

Make sure you have Go installed ([download](https://golang.org/dl/)). Version `1.17` or higher is required for this package.

Initialize your project by creating a folder and then running `go mod init github.com/your/repo` ([learn more](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules)) inside the folder. Then install Dusk with the [`go get`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Add_dependencies_to_current_module_and_install_them) command:

```bash
go get -u github.com/observerly/dusk
```

## Usage

The basic usage of this package is to use the `GetLocalTwilight()` func, this provides the Sun rise and Sun set times (in datetime format, as local time), it also provides the "duration" between these two datetimes. The local time is calculated from a UTC date for the speicif latitude and longitude coordiantes provided.

```go
var datetime time.Time = time.Date(2022, 2, 17, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC)

// observer's longitude, in degrees (*west of the Greenwhich meridian is negative, east is positive):
var longitude float64 = -155.8246

// observer's latitude, in degrees  (*south of the equator is negative, north is positive):
var latitude float64 = 20.0046

// observaer's elevation above mean sea level, in meteres:
var elevation float64 = 4207

// specify the twilight to be defined as a set number of degrees *below* the horizon (e.g, civil twilight is designated as being 6 degrees below horizon):
var degreesBelowHorizon float64 = -6

twilight, location, err := GetLocalTwilight(datetime, longitude, latitude, elevation, degreesBelowHorizon)
```

There are three wrapper functions which allow for an easy calculation of civil, nautical and astronomical twilight.

For civil twilight, the degreesBelowHorizon for the Sun needs to be -6Â°.

```go
twilight, location, err := GetLocalCivilTwilight(datetime, longitude, latitude, elevationn)
```

For civil twilight, the degreesBelowHorizon for the Sun needs to be -12Â°.

```go
twilight, location, err := GetLocalNauticalTwilight(datetime, longitude, latitude, elevationn)
```

For civil twilight, the degreesBelowHorizon for the Sun needs to be -18Â°.

```go
twilight, location, err := GetLocalAstronomicalTwilight(datetime, longitude, latitude, elevationn)
```
